abstract: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key technology nowadays and of enormous relevance for our society. A central characteristic of applications and methods from the field of AI is that they are highly interdisciplinary. Both mathematics, computer science, and other STEM as well as non-STEM disciplines are crucial depending on the application at hand. In addition, ethical considerations play an important role. Thus, together with the increasing demand to bring AI education into schools, comes the opportunity to design and implement interdisciplinary projects. In this paper, a developed digital learning module on the problem of human activity recognition on smartphones is used to show how interdisciplinary AI projects can be designed. We use a context-integration approach that focuses on mathematics embedded in mathematical modeling activities, while incorporating knowledge from computer science and physics.'
