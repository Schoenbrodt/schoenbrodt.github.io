abstract: The accelerating integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science into societal infrastructures is transforming how individuals interact, work, and make decisions. These changes are particularly pronounced for young people, whose lives are increasingly shaped by digital technologies. As AI systems become ever more pervasive, education systems must respond by equipping students with the knowledge, skills, and critical perspectives necessary to thrive in a data-driven world (Long & Magerko, 2020; Schüller, 2022; UNESCO, 2024). The Symposium on Integrating AI and Data Science into School Education Across Disciplines (AIDEA), convened in Salzburg, Austria, from February 24–28, 2025, addressed these imperatives by providing a platform for interdisciplinary exchange among over 60 international researchers, educators, and policymakers. This introductory paper highlights the symposium’s central themes and synthesizes the key insights and major findings presented in the symposium.
