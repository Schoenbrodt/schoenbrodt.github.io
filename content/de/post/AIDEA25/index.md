## International Symposium on AI and Data Science Education in K12

Together with Susanne Podworny and the ProDaBi-Team we are organizing the 1st International Symposium on Integrating AI and Data Science into School Education Across Disciplines [**AIDEA 2025**](https://aidea2025.github.io/) that will take place in February 2025, 24â€“28 in Salzburg, Austria.


The symposium aims to promote a broad understanding of the educational opportunities and challenges of AI as part of school subjects and of how to equip individuals, especially students at school level, with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate effectively in the AI-driven world. It focuses on education for learning AI and data science and the development of mathematical, statistical and computer science skills that can be linked to AI and data literacy.
