summary:  Vortrag auf der AIDEA 2025 (mit S. Schneider)

abstract: 'Due to the significance that AI applications already have for our society, AI education is considered an important part of contemporary education. Moreover, the topic of AI provides an interesting field of activity and subject area for various school subjects â€“ especially for computer science and mathematics education. The importance of AI education is now reflected in various computer science curricula in Germany and Austria. A key challenge for the comprehensive implementation of AI education and the holistic promotion of AI literacy in school is, on one hand, the availability of high-quality and up-to-date teaching and learning materials adapted to target groups and curricula, as well as the training of teachers in the field of AI. We address these challenges by providing teachers with materials for lessons on AI and machine learning through the teaching platform kiwi.schule and by training and educating (preservice) teachers through professional development courses and university seminars. Through the teaching and learning materials described below, exemplary lesson plans, a classroom management system, and AI tools for lesson preparation, teachers are supported in designing, adapting and teaching lessons on AI. The provided content aims to address and promote AI literacy and related competencies at different levels of cognitive learning objectives.'
