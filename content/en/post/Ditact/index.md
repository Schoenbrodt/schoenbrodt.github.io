## Women's IT studies

[ditact](https://ditact.ac.at/) is a successful, unique computer science and IT-centered course program by women for women in Austria. ditact has set itself the goal of motivating more women to enter the field of IT, to become active creators in these areas and thus to be successful in well-paid industries. 


I am also taking part in this year's ditact as a teacher of the [**STEM Workshop for girls**](https://ditact.ac.at/course/2532).
