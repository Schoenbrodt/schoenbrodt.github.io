## AI Education in the mathematics classroom!?

 Together with Rolf Biehler, I published the [**mathematik lehren**](https://www.friedrich-verlag.de/shop/ki-verstehen-wie-maschinen-lernen-58244) issue on education about AI in mathematics lessons. This was published in June 2024. 


Teaching AI is a challenge for many subjects: computer science, social and natural sciences, ethics and, of course, mathematics. AI is a dynamic field with modern mathematical and algorithmic methods.  The underlying methods and usually large, complex data sets cannot be broken down comprehensively in mathematics lessons. However, basic foundations for an understanding can be taught if various elementary mathematical topics are re-accentuated and modern applications are introduced. The issue provides math teachers with practical ideas and tested material for their own lessons. Some of the suggestions go beyond current curricula. With this issue, we would like to encourage practical experiences that have already been extensively tested in projects (including ProDaBi and CAMMP) and that could also become standard in regular lessons at some point.
