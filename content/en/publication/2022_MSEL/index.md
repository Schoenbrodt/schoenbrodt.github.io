abstract: 'To  enable  collaborative  modeling  activities  online  digital  tools  are  essential.  In  this  pa-per we present a holistic and adaptable concept for the development and implementationof  modeling  activities  â€“  which  could  especially  be  fruitful  in  times  of  homeschooling  anddistance learning. The concept is based on two digital tools: Jupyter Notebooks and a com-munication platform with video conferences.We carried out this concept in the context oftwo  types  of  modeling  activities:  guided  modeling  days,  where  the  students  work  on  pre-viously prepared and didactically developed digital learning material, and modeling weeks,in  which  the  students  work  on  open  problems  from  research  and  industry  very  freely.  Inthis paper the usage of Jupyter Notebook in modeling activities is presented and illustratedwith  the  example  of  the  optimization  of  a  solar  power  plant.  On  top,  we  share  our  expe-riences in online modeling activities with high-school students in Germany.'
